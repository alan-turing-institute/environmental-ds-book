# Guide for Community
Welcome to the guide for notebooks community of the EDS book! 

Before you begin this process, please be sure to [understand how the publication process works](pb-guidelines).

We have a [code of conduct](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alan-turing-institute/environmental-ds-book/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) which is mandatory for everyone involved in the review process of our notebooks.

Below you will find the main steps we suggest to follow to participate in a discussion of a submitted notebook to EDS book.

## Scope and Aims
Thank you for considering contributing to the review workflow of a notebook submission to EDS book.
Our review process aims to be open, collaborative, transparent and inclusive. 
We therefore welcome community feedback from a diversity of background and with varying levels of programming/domain expertise.

## Notebook Idea
We highly appreciate providing feedback to the notebook idea.
Any kind of suggestion related to datasets, open-source packages or ecosystems, credits, etc would be valuable for authors.  

In addition to the above contribution, anyone from the community with not much programming skills is welcome to suggest a Notebook Idea and ask for help to materialize it as a notebook submission.
Please refer to the section of Notebook Idea in the [guidelines for authors](pb-guidelines-authors) to get further details of the process.

## Post-publication
We encourage post-publication feedback from anyone interested in published notebooks in EDS book.
You can report bugs and derivative work in the notebook repository hosted by the [eds-book-gallery organisation](https://github.com/eds-book-gallery) (see for instance a [PR](https://github.com/eds-book-gallery/forest-modelling-treecrown_deepforest/pull/1) in the DeepForest notebook). 

Editors-in-Chief will contact notebook authors when changes are considerably relevant for either narrative or interactive contents.
If the authors consider suggestions as a substantial contribution, EiC will acknowledge it by adding the contributor's name to the citation of the notebook.
