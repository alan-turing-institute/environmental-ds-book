Hi, this is [EDITOR-Name]. 
I'm writing to ask if you have time to review a notebook for the Environmental Data Science (EDS) book. 
EDS book has an open peer review of computational notebooks that support environmental science. 
Accepted notebooks become a part of our EDS book notebooks gallery. 
Our review process is similar to that of open journals however it focuses on ensuring high quality notebooks that are reusable to the Environmental science community.

The notebook, [NOTEBOOK NAME] by [AUTHOR(S)], does [FUNCTION]. 
You can find it on GitHub here: [REPO LINK]. 
We conduct our open review process via GitHub as well, here: [PRE-REVIEW ISSUE]

If you accept, note that we ask reviewers to complete reviews in two weeks.

Our [reviewers guide](https://edsbook.org/guidelines-reviewers.html) details what we look for in a notebook review, and includes links to example reviews.
We also include a reviewer template on that page that you can use to guide your review. 

If you have time, please have a look at the notebook first, to make sure that you do not have a conflict of interest with the notebook authors.

If you have questions or feedback, feel free to ask me.

Are you able to review? If you can not, I welcome any suggestions that you have for other reviewers. 
If I don't hear from you within a week, I will assume that you are unable to review this package at this time.

Thank you for your time.

Sincerely,

[EDITOR]
EDS book editor.
