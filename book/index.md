Here’s what some of our contributors say:

> _“I had a great experience working on an EDS notebook. 
There was a learning curve but it helped me gain exposure to different technologies along with other people's work in Environmental Science. 
I hope to make far reaching impact through this work”_ 
> 
> -- Timothy Lam, Author

> _"Contributing to the EDS book has been an extremely valuable and enjoyable experience for me, giving me an insight into how open-source software development and code/book authorship can work within a more traditional scientific peer-review framework. 
Gaining this hands-on experience whilst learning about interesting environmental science applications has been one of the highlights of my PhD studies."_
