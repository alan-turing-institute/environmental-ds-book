## Async community support channels
If you're looking for asynchronous support or chat with the EDS book community, there are a lot of options:

* Start a discussion on [EDS book repository](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/environmental-ds-book/discussions).
* Open an [issue to report bugs or request features](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/environmental-ds-book/issues/new/choose).

# Open Research Communities

We collaborate with other open research communities to share knowledge and resources.
 
## Open Research Calendar
Additional to our co-working meetings and async communication channels, we encourage you to subscribe to the [Open Research Calendar (ORC)](https://openresearchcalendar.org/). 
ORC collects exciting events related to Open Research through a [Google Calendar](https://openresearchcalendar.org/calendar/) and [twitter bot](https://twitter.com/OpenResearchCal).
