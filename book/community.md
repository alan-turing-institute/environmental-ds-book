### Async community support channels
If you're looking for asynchronous support or chat with the EDS book community, there are a lot of options:

* Start a discussion on [EDS book repository](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/environmental-ds-book/discussions).
* Open an [issue to report bugs or request features](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/environmental-ds-book/issues/new/choose).

## Open Research Communities

We collaborate and amplify the work of other open research communities below.
