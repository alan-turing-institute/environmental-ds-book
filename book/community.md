# Community

## Meeting structure
- Collaboration cafes: we will continue our community shared-out of recent progress, achievements or events at _The Turing Way_ [Collaboration Cafes](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/community-handbook/coworking/coworking-collabcafe.html). At least one of core EDS book members (as described in the [Ways of Working document](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/environmental-ds-book/blob/master/ways_of_working.md)) will be attending the collaboration cafe to onboard or discuss relevant topics within _EDS book_ and _The Turing Way_ communities. Members of both communities are also welcome to join to [#environmental-sustainability](https://theturingway.slack.com/archives/C04RCMAEPUZ)) in _The Turing Way_ Slack, a dedicated channel for discussing broadly relevant topics aligned to Open Research in Environment & Sustainability.  
- Co-working sessions: we are merging separate working groups meetings into co-working sessions. According to the size of the call, we will create breakout rooms (to allow multiple small groups and discussions).

## Meeting dates and calendar
- Collaboration cafes: held fortnightly on the *first and third Wednesdays* of each month for 2 hours (see _The Turing Way_ [Community Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar?cid=dGhldHVyaW5nd2F5QGdtYWlsLmNvbQ)).
- Co-working sessions: held fortnightly on the *second Friday* of each month for 1 hour (see _EDS book_ [Community Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/1?cid=ZW52aXJvbm1lbnRhbC5kcy5ib29rQGdtYWlsLmNvbQ)).

## Async community support channels
If you're looking for asynchronous support or chat with the EDS book community, there are a lot of options:

* Start a discussion on [EDS book repository](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/environmental-ds-book/discussions).
* Chat with EDS book members; Join [our Gitter channel](https://matrix.to/#/#eds-book:gitter.im).
* Open an [issue to report bugs or request features](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/environmental-ds-book/issues/new/choose).

# Open Research Calendar
Additional to our community meetings and async communication channels, we encourage you to subscribe to the [Open Research Calendar (ORC)](https://openresearchcalendar.org/).

ORC collects exciting events related to Open Research through a [Google Calendar](https://openresearchcalendar.org/calendar/) and [twitter bot](https://twitter.com/OpenResearchCal).

The calendar's creators [Alexandra Lautarescu](https://twitter.com/AleLautarescu), [Bradley Kennedy](https://twitter.com/bradpsych), [Cassandra Gould van Praag](https://twitter.com/cassgvp) and [Esther Plomp](https://twitter.com/PhDToothFAIRy) built this fantastic tool at the ["Advanced Methods in Reproducible Science"](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/psychology/research/ukrn/ukrnevents/repro2020/) workshop (better known as [#Repro2020](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23repro2020)) in January 2020 based on an idea initially generated by attendees of [#Repro2019](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23repro2019).
Find out more about their work at [https://openresearchcalendar.github.io/Open-Research-Calendar](https://openresearchcalendar.github.io/Open-Research-Calendar/).

Anyone can add events to the calendar at [https://openresearchcalendar.org/add-event/](https://openresearchcalendar.org/add-event/).
