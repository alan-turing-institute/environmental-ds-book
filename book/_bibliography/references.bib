abstract={Research software is a fundamental and vital part of research, yet significant challenges to discoverability, productivity, quality, reproducibility, and sustainability exist. Improving the practice of scholarship is a common goal of the open science, open source, and FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable) communities and research software is now being understood as a type of digital object to which FAIR should be applied. This emergence reflects a maturation of the research community to better understand the crucial role of FAIR research software in maximising research value. The FAIR for Research Software (FAIR4RS) Working Group has adapted the FAIR Guiding Principles to create the FAIR Principles for Research Software (FAIR4RS Principles). The contents and context of the FAIR4RS Principles are summarised here to provide the basis for discussion of their adoption. Examples of implementation by organisations are provided to share information on how to maximise the value of research outputs, and to encourage others to amplify the importance and impact of this work.},

@article{Weinstein2020_MEE,
   abstract = {Abstract Remote sensing of forested landscapes can transform the speed, scale and cost of forest research. The delineation of individual trees in remote sensing images is an essential task in forest analysis. Here we introduce a new Python package, DeepForest that detects individual trees in high resolution RGB imagery using deep learning. While deep learning has proven highly effective in a range of computer vision tasks, it requires large amounts of training data that are typically difficult to obtain in ecological studies. DeepForest overcomes this limitation by including a model pretrained on over 30 million algorithmically generated crowns from 22 forests and fine-tuned using 10,000 hand-labelled crowns from six forests. The package supports the application of this general model to new data, fine tuning the model to new datasets with user labelled crowns, training new models and evaluating model predictions. This simplifies the process of using and retraining deep learning models for a range of forests, sensors and spatial resolutions. We illustrate the workflow of DeepForest using data from the National Ecological Observatory Network, a tropical forest in French Guiana, and street trees from Portland, Oregon.},

   abstract = {Tree crown detection is a fundamental task in remote sensing for forestry and ecosystem ecology. While many individual tree segmentation algorithms have been proposed, the development and testing of these algorithms is typically site specific, with few methods evaluated against data from multiple forest types simultaneously. This makes it difficult to determine the generalization of proposed approaches, and limits tree detection at broad scales. Using data from the National Ecological Observatory Network, we extend a recently developed deep learning approach to include data from a range of forest types to determine whether information from one forest can be used for tree detection in other forests, and explore the potential for building a universal tree detection algorithm. We find that the deep learning approach works well for overstory tree detection across forest conditions. Performance was best in open oak woodlands and worst in alpine forests. When models were fit to one forest type and used to predict another, performance generally decreased, with better performance when forests were more similar in structure. However, when models were pretrained on data from other sites and then fine-tuned using a relatively small amount of hand-labeled data from the evaluation site, they performed similarly to local site models. Most importantly, a model fit to data from all sites performed as well or better than individual models trained for each local site.},

   abstract = {Remote sensing can transform the speed, scale, and cost of biodiversity and forestry surveys. Data acquisition currently outpaces the ability to identify individual organisms in high resolution imagery. We outline an approach for identifying tree-crowns in RGB imagery while using a semi-supervised deep learning detection network. Individual crown delineation has been a long-standing challenge in remote sensing and available algorithms produce mixed results. We show that deep learning models can leverage existing Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR)-based unsupervised delineation to generate trees that are used for training an initial RGB crown detection model. Despite limitations in the original unsupervised detection approach, this noisy training data may contain information from which the neural network can learn initial tree features. We then refine the initial model using a small number of higher-quality hand-annotated RGB images. We validate our proposed approach while using an open-canopy site in the National Ecological Observation Network. Our results show that a model using 434,551 self-generated trees with the addition of 2848 hand-annotated trees yields accurate predictions in natural landscapes. Using an intersection-over-union threshold of 0.5, the full model had an average tree crown recall of 0.69, with a precision of 0.61 for the visually-annotated data. The model had an average tree detection rate of 0.82 for the field collected stems. The addition of a small number of hand-annotated trees improved the performance over the initial self-supervised model. This semi-supervised deep learning approach demonstrates that remote sensing can overcome a lack of labeled training data by generating noisy data for initial training using unsupervised methods and retraining the resulting models with high quality labeled data.},

@article{Andersson2021,
   abstract = {Anthropogenic warming has led to an unprecedented year-round reduction in Arctic sea ice extent. This has far-reaching consequences for indigenous and local communities, polar ecosystems, and global climate, motivating the need for accurate seasonal sea ice forecasts. While physics-based dynamical models can successfully forecast sea ice concentration several weeks ahead, they struggle to outperform simple statistical benchmarks at longer lead times. We present a probabilistic, deep learning sea ice forecasting system, IceNet. The system has been trained on climate simulations and observational data to forecast the next 6 months of monthly-averaged sea ice concentration maps. We show that IceNet advances the range of accurate sea ice forecasts, outperforming a state-of-the-art dynamical model in seasonal forecasts of summer sea ice, particularly for extreme sea ice events. This step-change in sea ice forecasting ability brings us closer to conservation tools that mitigate risks associated with rapid sea ice loss.},

## ocean-modelling-litter-philab

@inproceedings{Mifdal2021,
   abstract = {Marine litter is a growing problem that has been attracting attention and raising concerns over the last years. Significant quantities of plastic can be found in the oceans due to the unfiltered discharge of waste into rivers, poor waste management, or lost fishing nets. The floating elements drift on the surface of water bodies and can be aggregated by processes, such as river plumes, windrows, oceanic fronts, or currents. In this paper, we focus on detecting big patches of floating objects that can contain plastic as well as other materials with optical Sentinel 2 data. In contrast to previous work that focuses on pixel-wise spectral responses of some bands, we employ a deep learning predictor that learns the spatial characteristics of floating objects. Along with this work, we provide a hand-labeled Sentinel 2 dataset of floating objects on the sea surface and other water bodies such as lakes together with pre-trained deep learning models. Our experiments demonstrate that harnessing the spatial patterns learned with a CNN is advantageous over pixel-wise classifications that use hand-crafted features. We further provide an analysis of the categories of floating objects that we captured while labeling the dataset and analyze the feature importance for the CNN predictions. Finally, we outline the limitations of trained CNN on several systematic failure cases that we would like to address in future work by increasing the diversity in the dataset and tackling the domain shift between regions and satellite acquisitions. The dataset introduced in this work is the first to provide public large-scale data for floating litter detection and we hope it will give more insights into developing techniques for floating litter detection and classification.

   abstract = {Cosmic-ray soil moisture sensors have the advantage of a large measurement footprint (approximately 700 m in diameter) and are able to operate continuously to provide area-averaged near-surface (top 10–20 cm) volumetric soil moisture content at the field scale. This paper presents the application of this technique at four sites in southern England over almost 3 years. Results show the soil moisture response to contrasting climatic conditions during 2011–2014 and are the first such field-scale measurements made in the UK. These four sites are prototype stations for a UK COsmic-ray Soil Moisture Observing System, and particular consideration is given to sensor operating conditions in the UK. Comparison of these soil water content observations with the Joint UK Land Environment Simulator 10-cm soil moisture layer shows that these data can be used to test and diagnose model performance and indicate the potential for assimilation of these data into hydro-meteorological models. The application of these large-area soil water content measurements to evaluate remotely sensed soil moisture products is also demonstrated. Numerous applications and the future development of a national COsmic-ray Soil Moisture Observing System network are discussed. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},
