# Context
With the great diversity in open data, software and computational resources, environmental data science research and applications have accelerated rapidly. 
This presents a timely opportunity for advancing the cyberinfrastructure for showcasing these emerging developments. 
Building upon existing open science communities such as the [Turing Way](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/) and [Pangeo](https://pangeo.io), EDS book aims to complement the science and methodological development embedded within academic journals using open infrastructure to translate research outputs into FAIR notebooks which benefit from a collaborative and open reviewing process [](#my-fig).

# Vision

To showcase and support the publication of data, research and open-source tools using Data Science and AI for characterizing, monitoring and/or modeling a wide diversity of environmental systems.

# Mission

Educate and leverage good scientific software and data management practices among environmental scientists through peer-reviewed findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable (FAIR) executable notebooks.

In addition to the book, our goal is to build a computational notebook community putting open science into practice towards collaborative, reusable and transparent environmental research.

# Who is the book for?

While the scientific community is broad, we think the target audience of this book is:

* Researchers with some background in environmental science interested in AI and data science methods.
* Researchers with some background in computer science interested in environmental data science.  
* Anyone else interested in reproducibility, inclusive, shareable and collaborative open environmental science.
