### Breakout rooms: Topic proposals

*Topics for breakout / Names*

* Main stage (silent mode)
    * Bea: working on the submission of her PhD thesis.
    * Alejandro: 
        * adding helpful resources about FAIR and example of research repositories for Environmental Sciences.
        * checking which sample data within the Environmental Data Science book can be curated in [the Environmental Data Science Zenodo community](https://zenodo.org/communities/the-environmental-ds-community/?page=1&size=20).

### Notes and questions

* Alejandro
    * Useful resources about FAIR :
        * [FAIR Cookbook](https://fairplus.github.io/the-fair-cookbook/content/home.html): an online resource for the Life Sciences with recipes to make and keep data FAIR.
        * [The Turing Way: The FAIR Principles](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/reproducible-research/rdm/rdm-fair.html?highlight=fair): light introduction to FAIR principles, pointing to key resources in the topic.
        * [Library Carpentry: FAIR Data and Software](https://librarycarpentry.org/lc-fair-research/aio/index.html): lesson exploring the meaning of FAIR elements. 
    * Research data platforms:
        * General
            * [re3data.org](https://www.re3data.org/): initiative indexing research data platforms by content topic and knowledge domain.
            * [Stats datacite](https://stats.datacite.org/): dashboard mapping the registration of persistent identifiers (DOIs) for research data and other research outputs.
        * Environmental science (list of platforms with the highest number of total DOIs registrations according to Stats datacite):
            * [Global Biodiversity Information Facility](https://www.gbif.org/)
            * [FAO Global Information System of the International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture (PGRFA)](https://ssl.fao.org/glis/)
            * [PANGAEA](https://www.pangaea.de/): earth system research.
            * [Environmental Data Initiative (EDI)](https://portal.edirepository.org/nis/home.jsp): platform suited to curate environmental data, includes code snippets to import the data across multiple programming languages (python, R).
            
    * Other interesting FAIR-driven platforms:
        * [ROHub](https://reliance.rohub.org/): research object management platform supporting the preservation and lifecycle management of scientific investigations, research campaigns and operational processes. It implements FAIR digital objects and specific metadata for data-cube in Earth Science. 

    * Challenges of FAIR data repositories for Environmental sciences (ES):
        * ES is structured as tabular data collected in the field or laboratory (see further discussion in [BEXIS2](https://bdj.pensoft.net/article/72901/)).
        * FAIR-enabled data available could be daunting for many ES researchers and organisations due to the lack of awareness, efficient data management tools, infrastructure and skills [see further discussion in BEXIS2](https://bdj.pensoft.net/article/72901/)).
        * Spatio-temporal (data cubes) > this seems to be adressed by novel research object management platforms such as [ROHub](https://reliance.rohub.org/).
    
### Request for reviews!

* None

### Feedback at the end of the call

* Alejandro: Few participants in this particular collaboration cafe. We should restructure the promotion strategy, proposing new topics and/or changing the format for coming collaborations cafes in 2022 :face_with_monocle:.

* EGU22 session was accepted, [Bridging the spatial scales, from surface sensors to satellite sensors: Innovative approaches towards the construction of Earth’s digital twin](https://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EGU22/session/43565). Deadlines:
    * Abstract submission deadline: 12 January 2022, 13:00 CET
    * Travel Support application deadline: 1 December 2021

### Breakout rooms: Topic proposals

*Topics for breakout / Names*

* Matt, making a reproducible GitHub code for his MRes dissertation
* Alejandro, preparing contributions guidelines for the Environmentel AI book 
* Sam J, exploration of resources for reproducibility and feedback on Matt and Alejandro's topics

### Notes and questions

* Sam J:
    *  [The Turing Way](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/welcome), a great resource to guide Environmental scientist in reproducible research.
    *  [Cornell Dataset Description](https://cornell.app.box.com/v/ReadmeTemplate) a good starting template for dataset documentation!
    *  Standards in data catalogues, e.g. [STAC](https://stacspec.org) (but it isn't mature)
* Alejandro:
    * Zenodo:
        * It is great to keep your sample data (up to 50 GB).
    * notebooksharing.space
        * A nice resource to share notebooks with interactive plotting (up to 10Mb). However, it doesn't allow track changes as [ReviewNB](https://www.reviewnb.com) does. 
    * Contributors guidelines for the EnvAI book
        * Sam suggests example environmental python packages with links to notebooks (e.g. hvplot, geopandas etc.)
        * Minimal publishable version guidelines e.g. Binder
        * Use external links for general versioning principles e.g. how to pull request in Github
        * Provide examples how to create lock environments 
        * Section of tools for sharing notebooks e.g. ReviewNB, notebooksharing.space
* Matt
    * Publishing reproducible code for environmental science
        * It can be more important that the process can be reproduced rather than accuracies to the nearest 0.01%
        * Use a subset of data to demonstrate the tool where the owners aren't happy to share the whole thing - training & inference
        * In env science a visual demonstration of the results can be more useful than a commandline readout of accuracy
        * Suggest sensible ranges for hyperparameters in the documentation

### Request for reviews!

* **Sam J**: reviewers need for SEVIRI wildfire data notebook of the EnvAI book, see [PR#12](https://github.com/acocac/environmental-ai-book/pull/12)

### Feedback at the end of the call

* None

* Met Office / Joint centre for excellence in environmental intelligence conference 16/17 Dec 2021!
* We have a fresh interactive notebook in the Environmental Data S Book :earth_asia::books: The notebook focuses on detecting tree crowns using the *DeepForest* model :deciduous_tree:. Have a look at the rendered version [here](https://acocac.github.io/environmental-ai-book/forest/modelling/forest-modelling-treecrown_deepforest.html). Other recent community contributions are the exploration of sensor data, [Met Office UKV high-resolution atmosphere model data for urban settings](https://acocac.github.io/environmental-ai-book/urban/sensors/urban-sensors-ukv.html) and [MODIS satellite imagery and wildfire data](https://acocac.github.io/environmental-ai-book/wildfires/sensors/wildfires-sensors-modis.html).

### Breakout rooms: Topic proposals

*Topics for breakout / Names*

* Sam A. Manufacture Urban Data in GIS format
* Evie. Preprocessing satellite data for crop yield prediction
* Alejandro. Preprocess FluxNet data and related gridded products

### Notes and questions

* We showcased the [SEPAL platform](https://docs.sepal.io/en/latest/cookbook/area_estimation.html) for Vegetation Satellite Image analysis. 
* Discussed challenges around scoping and extracting satellite data for machine learning models of vegetation (agricultural crops):
    * Appropriate satellite platform (Sentinel/LANDSAT?)
    * Preprocessing of radar and optical data (i.e. dealing with cloud cover)
    * Appropriate time series/critical dates for plant growth
* Sam A. used ArcGIS pro to extract site-specific temperature information from a gridded netCDF dataset using the Spatial Analyst 'Sample' tool. It is very useful in that it works across the time dimension so I could do this for 1 year of data in one go. It is also possible to set a desired output coordinate system. I could save the data out as a csv file and then use standard python tools like pandas and numpy for further processing  
* Sam A. suggests using [Iris package](https://scitools-iris.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for reprojecting gridded netCDF files. The project is
* Data preprocessing is still too time-consuming, and there is lack of communication of the tools available.

### Notes and questions

* Emily showed a cool visualization of a laser scan image (100 GB) using the propietary software of the scanner device. After data preprocessing, she will use  libraries for visualizing individual trees. 
    * Emily says there are also some radar sensors that collect soil data. 
* Tools for regridding MODIS data. Sam is using [*satpy*](https://satpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/overview.html). Suggestions of other existing tools are welcome. 
* Tom is making his code nicer i.e. modules and efficient i.e using dask. 
* Alejandro shows FluxNet demo
    * Emily suggest adding woodlands and shrubs to subset FluxNet data. 

### Feedback at the end of the call
